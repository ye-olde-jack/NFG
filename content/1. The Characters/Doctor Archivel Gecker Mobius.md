[[Doctor Archivel Gecker Mobius]]' origins are not fully known, asking him about his past will result in him giving a vague spiel on how he was born in a small village called Ornstal in Caspia, to a doctor mother and a mechanic father. He soon learned he was [[mageborn]], and after his parents saved enough money, sent him to [[The Amethyst Academy]] where he earned degrees in Biomancy, Mechanical Engineering, Magical Engineering, Biomagical Engineering and a pursued a minor in Primordial. During research, he met [[Spencer D. Kramer]], a fellow scientist, whom he had a bitter rivalry with. The two tried endlessly to best each other, their malicious competition ending when Kramer mysteriously disappeared. Hearing of the unprecedented magical potential of [[Delerium]], he pulled some strings and did some favors for the Amethyst Academy to be sent there on assignment to conduct research on the mysterious mineral.
