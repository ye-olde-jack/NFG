After being born in a comfortable household in [[Drakkenheim]], it was taken from him by the meteor. Rupert McNamara then fought during the [[Civil War of Drakkenheim]] to rescue survivors and civilians from the spawning monstrosities until his wife died. At which point he'd had enough of the petty squabbles of the Civil War, swearing an oath to destroy that which took everything from him- that damned meteor. Years after the Civil War, Rupert McNamara has joined forces with the [[Knights of the Silver Order]], which were also recently joined by [[Thalia Bleakheart]] who he is mentoring. An old war friend who he had saved the life of, [[Emile D'Arlan]], comes into the picture with a potential job the Silver Order would also like to see done.
