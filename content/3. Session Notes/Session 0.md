# Agreed upon Home Rules
- Non-Lethal attacks are made with disadvantage, enemies have advantage on any saving throws from non-lethal attacks, and advantage on any ability checks per DM ruling.
- When using healing potions, a bonus action leads to rolling health from the potion and an action leads to taking the full amount the potion would provide. As a result, healing potions are less frequent and rare.
- Point system: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nf1Ap_JZEOa9NExeGznkTLxzShiyklWdlfgZmJGTTpA/edit
	- List will progressively get added to over the course of the game.
	- When leveling up or during investment of downtime, a discussion can be brought up for group uses for points. Development needs to happen for this option to be made available.
- Research/Training is available during downtime through expenditure of resources such as time, gold, maybe points from the homebrew points rule, or material components in game. Possible Results from Research/Training:
	- Creating new spells.
	- Improving preexisting spells.
	- Improving preexisting class abilities.
	- Creating magic or mundane items.
	- Learning new facts about the city, delirium, the Haze, or other unknown phenomena.
- Death saves are rolled behind the screen, between DM and dying player to know.
- Prone revision.
	- Only takes 15 feet to stand up instead of half movement.
	- You provoke an attack of opportunity when standing up from Prone, unless you expend your full movement.
- Crunchy crits.
	- Base weapon damage is maximized and added to a flat roll.
	- Extra dice from features and spells are doubled, though not maximized.
- Flanking.
	- +2 when Flanking.
- Known spells can be swapped out during a long rest.
	- Update DM on swaps.
