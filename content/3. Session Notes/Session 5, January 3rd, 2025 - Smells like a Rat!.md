# Bullets
- Session started with party going into Drakkenheim, 1:30 PM.
	- Stopped to take a rest and plan for the first foray into the city.
	- Emile made some makeshift meals.
- Began heading into the city, with a trip to the Ferryman in mind.
- After meeting with the Ferryman and scouting the surrounding areas, they took the boat across the Dran River for the price of one gold piece. During this, the Ferryman stopped to deposit some of the gold along the way.
- Made it to the other semi-flooded side, passing along some of the support temporary structures placed by other travelers.
- Took break after hearing Hooded Lantern supply group heading through and being assaulted by a number of haze husks as well as a huge Hulk.
	- A skill challenge ensued, during which Emile lost use of some of his equipment and Thalia's spellcasting was inhibited until they take time to repair or heal themselves.
		- Rupert expended some points to cleanse some of the water around the group, leading to the monsters being kept at bay temporarily.
		- Levi aided the challenge by getting a lay of the land and by stealthing to survey the scene.
		- Emile did some acrobatics, signaled to the Hooded Lanterns to get them moving, and attempted going back to converse during the hectic fray- failing to do so and getting out of some combat by the skin of his teeth.
		- Dr. Mobius set up a firework to distract the monsters, which he was able to do without accidentally routing the Hooded Lanterns thanks to the efforts of Emile.
		- Thalia managing to momentarily daze a Haze Hulk.
	- Party departs from skill challenge after attempt to double back, moving on to Scrag Lane.
		- On the way out they noticed one individual, Rupert recognizing Officer Yannick, a curmudgeon from the days of the civil war.
	- Scrag Lane was where the party found the Rat's Nest Tavern- a mere shadow of what it once was and a small show of what a fragment of a meteor could do to the city.
	- Preparing themselves to the enter the tavern and discussing the opportunity of working with Ratlings, the party ventured forwards in a marching line up until Rupert encountered the slip and slide, throwing out his back.
		- Discovered six delerium chips along the way!
	- First combat broke out, party handily dispatching their first group of Ratlings.
	- Post-combat interrogation ensued.
		- Learned that the large chunk of Delerium is with Squeaks the Seer.
		- Learned that a woman Hooded Lantern is being kept alive in one of the feeding room storages.
		- Secured a Hooded Lantern semi-automatic rifle, of dwarven make.
		- Group of Hooded Lanterns was more than the first skirmish.
	- The party let go of the ratlings after the fight, telling him to come back in seven days.
	- From there, the party went to the diverting passages and encountered an ambush! Ending the session.
- Session ended at 3:37 PM for the Feast of the Faithful, 11/30/1914.
