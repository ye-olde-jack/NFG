A safe haven where adventurers may rest, recuperate, and resupply between their adventures in [[Drakkenheim]]. Equipment, lodgings, spellcasting services, a few magic items, and other amenities are available from the many folk dwelling in the village.

Two decades ago, Emberwood Village was little more than a farmers market, blacksmith, a pub, a small chapel and a few dozen cottages. The local businesses served the farmlands and logging camps surrounding the capital, and the town was an occasional rest stop for merchants to stop off on their way to Drakkenheim. 

As the town lies some five miles south of the capital city, it was not directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows of every building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in the village blinded or deafened. Unfortunately, the aftermath was all the more terrible. Over the past fifteen years, the [[contamination]] in Drakkenheim has affected the countryside for miles around. The once fertile fields and dense woods are now barren and dying. Gradually, most folk gave up, departing for safer and more prosperous places. A few people remained behind, determined to hold onto their family homes and salvage their livelihoods.
