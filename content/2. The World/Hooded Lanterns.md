#Hooded_Lanterns 

Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old [[Drakkenheim]] City Watch. Led by the dour [[Lord Commander Elias Drexel]], they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation’s capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of [[Westemär]]. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns’ efforts. These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.
