#Lore 

No one knows when elves came to these lands, or exactly how they got here. Even the eldest among them tell little more than vague myths about their origins. These stories claim that millennia ago, the elves came into this world through distant realms and shadowy gates from a distant and long-lost land. Why the elves left, none can say. Today, the elves live in diaspora within the nearby territory of [[Arcadia]]. Only a handful of elven families dwell in even the most populous regions. Although rare, they are no longer regarded as strangers to these lands. In fact, half-elves are now much more common than those of pure elven descent. Though elves remember little of their history, they still possess great knowledge of magic and a stronger likelihood to be mageborn. The few elven ruins found across the continent contain mysterious portals and arcane lore. The reason they were abandoned remains unknown.
