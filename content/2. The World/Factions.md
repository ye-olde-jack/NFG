- The [[Amethyst Academy]]:
 ![[Pasted image 20241105132411.png]]


[[The Amethyst Academy]] is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards, where students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities. Directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages, [[The Amethyst Academy]] also operates an enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares, and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow following [[Drakkenheim]]’s destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold: the [[Inscrutable Tower]]. [[Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver]] leads the Academy’s efforts to access the tower and safeguard the secret lore within. Meanwhile, their survey teams conduct ongoing research regarding [[delerium]]’s supernatural qualities and unknown dangers. The mages plan to harness the crystals’ vast energies to craft magical items and power new arcane spells.

- [[Followers of the Falling Fire]]:

The annihilation of [[Drakkenheim]] incited a serious religious schism within the Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the [[Followers of the Falling Fire]], who adhere to the prophecies of former [[Lucretia Mathias]]. She attests that delerium is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.

- [[Hooded Lanterns]]:

Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the [[Hooded Lanterns]] are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old [[Drakkenheim]] City Watch. Led by the dour [[Lord Commander Elias Drexel]], they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation’s capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of [[Westemär]]. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns’ efforts. These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.

- [[Knights of the Silver Order]]:

The [[Knights of the Silver Order]] are an organization of oathbound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the [[Faith of the Sacred Flame]], the dominant religion across the continent. They believe [[delerium]] is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment has been dispatched to [[Drakkenheim]] to carry out this righteous task, led by [[Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal]].

- [[Queen's Men]]:

The [[Queen's Men]] are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all of whom owe fealty to the enigmatic [[Queen of Thieves]]. These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle [[delerium]] to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The [[Queen of Thieves]] dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, and conspires against the other factions at every turn.
