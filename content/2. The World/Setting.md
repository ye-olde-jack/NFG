The people who inhabit the world of [[Drakkenheim]] simply call it “the earth” or “the world”. They live on “the continent” that is divided into several nations which people refer to as “the realms”. The largest and most politically influential of these sovereign states are [[Caspia]], [[Elyria]], and [[Westemär]]. Neighboring each are several petty kingdoms and dozens of city states.
