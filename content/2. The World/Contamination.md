#Lore 

Characters exploring [[Drakkenheim]] may be exposed to eldritch pollutants within the [[Haze]] or arcane radiation emitted by [[delerium]]. These hazards cause a new condition called **contamination**, which inflicts both debilitating symptoms and otherworldly mutations. Contamination is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of contamination, as specified in the effect’s description. If an already contaminated creature suffers another effect that causes further contamination, its current level of contamination increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

**Contamination Effects**
- Level one: ???
- Level two: ???
- Level three: ???
- Level four: ???
- Level five: ???
- Level six: ???
