#Lore 

Characters exploring [[Drakkenheim]] may be exposed to eldritch pollutants within the [[Haze]] or arcane radiation emitted by [[delerium]]. Monsters and other creatures within the city may also be able to inflict contamination upon would be explorers, prospectors, and heroes.

These hazards cause a new condition called **contamination**, which inflicts both debilitating symptoms and otherworldly mutations. Contamination is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of contamination, as specified in the effect’s description. If an already contaminated creature suffers another effect that causes further contamination, its current level of contamination increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. Additionally, when becoming contaminated, a series of questions is asked to the one suffering the effect and if enough are answered with 'yes' then there is a potential to mutate. A d6 is rolled and if the number on the die is equal to or lower than the number of contamination levels a character has, they will roll for a potential mutation.

**Contamination Effects**
- Level one: Spares any outwardly negative effect for later levels.
- Level two: Any hit die rolled are treated half as effective, only restoring half the total amount.
- Level three: ???
- Level four: ???
- Level five: ???
- Level six: ???

**Status:**
- Levi: 2nd level of contamination, one mutation.
- Rupert: 1st level of contamination, zero mutations.
