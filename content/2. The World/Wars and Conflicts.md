The realms have been shaped by centuries of war, from [Elyrian](Elyria) rebellions against ancient [[sorcerer-kings]], to great battles between rival [Caspian](Caspia) princes, and most recently, the civil war that ravaged [[Westemär]]. By law and custom, none with arcane spellcasting powers may hold a noble title within the realms. Instead, the noble houses prize the martial arts. Many fighting traditions have developed: armored phalanxes, archery, fencing, berzerking, and diverse unarmed combat techniques. Duels and trial by combat are a particularly favored means to settle disputes amongst the nobility with minimal bloodshed. The realms of [[Caspia]], [[Elyria]], and [[Westemär]] have each developed their own distinctive styles and practices for such contests.
