Many dwarves tell tales of ancient underground kingdoms that hoarded vast mines of gold and gems and fought great wars miles below the surface. The foundations upon which [[Drakkenheim]] were built date back to these times, and traces of dwarven architecture and engineering can still be found in the fortifications, aqueducts, and deep vaults of the city. However, the days of the dwarven realms have long passed, and the dwarven people have no great holds of their own any more. Still, many dwarves dwell in the mountains and keep the traditions of their ancestors: mining, smithing, and engineering. Many more are much less tied to these traditions now, so it is not unusual to see a small number of dwarves in just about any community.
