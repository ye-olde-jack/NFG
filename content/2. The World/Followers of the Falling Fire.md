#Falling_Fire 

The annihilation of [[Drakkenheim]] incited a serious religious schism within the Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the [[Followers of the Falling Fire]], who adhere to the prophecies of former Flamekeeper [[Lucretia Mathias]]. She attests that [[delerium]] is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.

# Ideals
- A New Age of Heroes shall meet the Creeping Darkness that threatens the world. Through our devotion, we shall light the Sacred Flame.
- Every soul is worthy of redemption, you need only see the good within. From the darkest shadow comes the brightest light.
- Material possessions and monetary wealth hold no value anymore. All that matters is our faith.
- We are fascinated by the stars, and see omens and prophecy in everything.
- We see hope for the downtrodden and absolution for the lost. We offer deliverance and mercy for any who seek the truth and the light, but we condemn those who do not.
- Delerium shards have a sacred purpose as the key to our salvation.
