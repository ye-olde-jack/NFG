During antiquity, mighty sorcerer-kings ruled a continent spanning empire using their immense arcane power. The sorcerer-kings became tyrants who scarred the land with magical wars and held those without arcane magical power in bondage. The iron rule of the sorcerer-kings was ended following the martyrdom of [[Saint Tarna]], ended by those who followed in her footsteps- clerics and paladins of the [[Faith of the Sacred Flame]] a thousand years ago.
