# **Drakkenheim's Factions**

- The [[Amethyst Academy]]:  
![[Pasted image 20241105132411.png]]

The [[Amethyst Academy]] is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards, where students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities. Directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages, the [[Amethyst Academy]] also operates an enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares, and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow following [[Drakkenheim]]’s destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold: the Inscrutable Tower. Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver leads the Academy’s efforts to access the tower and safeguard the secret lore within. Meanwhile, their survey teams conduct ongoing research regarding delerium’s supernatural qualities and unknown dangers. The mages plan to harness the crystals’ vast energies to craft magical items and power new arcane spells.

- [[Followers of the Falling Fire]]: 
![[Pasted image 20241105133629.png]]

The annihilation of Drakkenheim incited a serious religious schism within the Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of the Falling Fire, who adhere to the prophecies of former Flamekeeper Lucretia Mathias. She attests that delerium is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.

- [[Hooded Lanterns]]: 
![[Pasted image 20241105133732.png]]

Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the dour Lord Commander Elias Drexel, they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation’s capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns’ efforts. These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.

- [[Knights of the Silver Order]]: 
![[Pasted image 20241105133802.png]]

The Knights of the Silver Order are an organization of oathbound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment has been dispatched to Drakkenheim to carry out this righteous task, led by Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal.

- [[Queen's Men]]: 
![[Pasted image 20241105133834.png]]

The Queen’s Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all of whom owe fealty to the enigmatic Queen of Thieves. These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, and conspires against the other factions at every turn.

# **Valikan Clans**

- [[Clan Rune]]: 
![[Pasted image 20241105132608.png]]

Life among the Rune clan is no less arduous than for others in Valika. However, the clan’s deep connections to magic give its people a unique focus among the northlanders, and a notably broader worldview than that of many other clans provides an advantageous perspective. The clan is named for the sorcerer Rune, the legendary spellcaster who joined Kentigern to free the north from the scourge of Gormadraug, the Great Prismatic Wyrm. One of the most formidable of Kentigern’s companions, Rune was also one of the most widely traveled, appearing in ancient tales from across Etharis. In the tales of Valika, Rune is best known for helping hold back Gormadraug’s elemental powers during the battles that allowed the Seven Heroes to finally face off against the Prismatic Wyrm, and for imprisoning the fire elementals of Cinderghast. It is those legendary tales of spellcraft and magic against which the folk of Clan Rune measure themselves as they carry on Rune’s legacy.

- [[Clan Sýr]]:
![[Pasted image 20241105133537.png]]

The most legendary metalworkers of the north hail from Clan Sýr, founded by and named for Sýr the Seven-Bladed, the thrice-condemned warrior and weaponsmith who made their name among the Seven Heroes who defeated Gormadraug. Little is known of Sýr’s life before they entered Kentigern’s saga, aside from the death sentences imposed on them by various chiefs of the ancient clans, dwelling outside the territory of the elementals that ruled the northern wastes. While they lived, Sýr resisted all attempts by the skalds and lorists to unlock the secrets of their past, though it is generally accepted that their seven blades were each commissioned works, originally undertaken by Sýr for powerful chiefs and warriors. Incomplete tales also suggest that Sýr kept all those weapons for themself—even after having pocketed their extraordinary commissions—judging in the end that each was too beautiful and too deadly to ever be handled by another.

- [[Clan Völgr]]:
![[Pasted image 20241105133507.png]]

When most folk of the Etharis southlands think of Valika, they think of Clan Völgr, whether they know that name or not. The shape and power of the north is defined by the predations of Völgr raiders, and the attacks they’ve made against seaports, fishing villages, and river communities across the southlands of Etharis for generations. The clan is named for Völgr Clad-in-Iron, one of the Seven Heroes who slew the Great Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug and gifted all Valika to the humanoids who now dwell there. Völgr was a legendary warrior, said to never remove the scarred black-iron full plate for which he was known, and trusting his companions to deal with all conflicts not best defeated with steel and blood. The folk of the north endure more than their share of such conflicts even today, and Völgr’s clan embraces that hardship more than those of any other clan. They are dedicated to the arts of battle and the thrill of violence—and to the knowledge that by the violence they offer to the world, they keep that world safe from ruin.

- [[Clan Mithra]]:
![[Pasted image 20241105133434.png]]

Clan Mithra Of all the clans of Valika, Mithra is the most cosmopolitan and the most inviting to people from beyond Valika’s borders. Governed by their elected leader Queen Andrea Helsing, the folk of Clan Mithra see themselves as a force for order in the chaos that surrounds them. While some view themselves as the light shining through the last vestiges of a dying world, others contend that the world has always been dying, gods or no, and the wisest course is to get on about the business of living well until death takes the last person standing. Named for Mithra of the Silver Harp, Clan Mithra takes the legacy of the musical ability and world-spanning knowledge of their namesake seriously. While there is no established college in Hrist, the Skald Library, where the Lord Edda was codified, is treated as a most holy place. Poetry and song competitions are common, and quarrels are frequently settled through flytings, rhyming battles-by-insult.

[[Clan Morgöng]]:
![[Pasted image 20241105133408.png]]

Despite siding with Clan Mithra and Clan Limgri in the current battle against Thrull, Clan Morgöng is the clan most likely to identify with the motivations of their western neighbors. The people follow a yearly cycle of a short planting season before raiding through midsummer, which leads to a short harvest followed by further raids. The year concludes with a long winter at home, sharing and exchanging secrets gathered along their voyages. Due to their violent and dangerous lives, Clan Morgöng has often used raids to increase their population, taking thralls from among the southern villages they raid along the eastern coastline of Etharis. Since many of those folks are under the heavy and imposing thumbs of the Ostoyan Crimson Court, a better life often awaits in Valika. Thralls are given a term of service, after which they may return to their homelands, but the people of Clan Morgöng seek to encourage thralls to become part of the clan once their term is complete. Thus, thralls are frequently treated, from the beginning of their term, as part of the family holding their service. The result is that Clan Morgöng is even more diverse than the more cosmopolitan Clan Mithra. The diversity in appearance benefits Clan Morgöng in another way: they send spies both to the north and south, dealing in secrets more than any other export. Because there is very little in the way of a central government among the clan’s settlements, these secrets are frequently traded among the various villages as well. While no one member of Clan Morgöng knows all the secrets of the clan, the clan as a whole is said to know the entire world’s hidden thoughts.

[[Clan Limgri]]:
![[Pasted image 20241105133320.png]]

The frigid north is a hard land, and no one knows this better than Clan Limgri. The nomadic people of the clan traverse the northernmost parts of Kandar, many of them living half the year in full darkness. It’s a life that suits Clan Limgri, as their beliefs are rooted in the end of the world: darkness has come, the gods are dead, and everything must end. Of all the major clans of Valika, Clan Limgri has learned the most from the Svalr, the original people of the north. From this now-minor clan, the Limgri learned how to herd reindeer, how to build shelters from snow, and how to write magic onto their own bodies. Unlike Clan Rune, with its sophisticated understanding of magic, the people of Clan Limgri have a limited understanding of traditional tattoo magic, having borrowed it from Svalr, combined it with rune magic, and adopted it as their own.
