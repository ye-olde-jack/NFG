#The_Sacred_Flame 

The [[Knights of the Silver Order]] are an organization of oathbound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the [[Faith of the Sacred Flame]], the dominant religion across the continent. They believe [[delerium]] is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment has been dispatched to [[Drakkenheim]] to carry out this righteous task, led by [[Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal]].
