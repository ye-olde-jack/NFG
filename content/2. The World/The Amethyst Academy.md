#Amethyst_Academy 

One of the [[Factions]] within [[Drakkenheim]]. The Amethyst Academy is a research institute, educational organization, and mage guild pursuing the arcane mysteries of delerium. The faction is small and outwardly aloof, yet subtly influential and tremendously wealthy. They are led by a shadowy directorate of powerful archmages who dispatched [[Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver]] to oversee their operations in Drakkenheim. Most of its members are potent arcane spellcasters with access to rare magical resources, but only a handful of agents are active in [[Drakkenheim]].
