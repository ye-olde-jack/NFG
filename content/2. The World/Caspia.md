The realm of Caspia stretches in an expanse between the [[Glimmer Mountains]] and the [[Diamond Sea]]. It is a rugged and Mediterranean nation, home to a boisterous and affable people led by a constantly squabbling nobility. 

# The Kingsmoot 
Caspians elect their High King once each decade, from candidates put forth by the princes of their noble houses. The valorous deeds and reputation of the noble houses is a major factor in determining the High King. Though Caspian politics are always shifting, especially as the next Kingsmoot draws near, it has stood as a remarkably stable nation. As such, Caspians love to meddle in the politics of [[Elyria]] and [[Westem√§r]]. They often intermarry with the nobles of different realms to gain greater clout and influence for the next Kingsmoot.
