Commerce, rather than conflict, defines everyday life for common folk in the realms. Merchant caravels and ships frequently carry cargo across the Diamond Sea from the Caspian port of Jackson’s Keep or the independent city-state of Liberio. Other vessels depart from the ports of Drannsmund in Westemär and Angel’s Landing in Elyria, and sail the Middle Ocean to the far west. Trade caravans from Geldstadt travel across the Twin Vales to distant lands beyond the steppes. Magical goods and services are bought and sold throughout the continent, but only amongst the wealthy and powerful. High-ranking nobles outfit their favored knights with magical arms and armor, and rich merchants buy spells and wondrous items to safeguard their valuable mundane wares. The manufacture and sale of arcane commodities is controlled by the Mage Guild, a branch of the Amethyst Academy. Under strict edicts recognized across the realms, any mage or trader dealing in magic pays an annual fee to the Mage Guild, and must follow the prices set by the guild. A few are bold enough to skirt these requirements. As a result, smugglers, hired muscle, and rogues can make their fortune in the illicit trade of enchanted gear and forbidden magic items. This underground black market has only expanded since delerium has become such a valuable and sought-after export.
