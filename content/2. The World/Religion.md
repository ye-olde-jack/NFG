Drakkenheim Religion: In the world of Drakkenheim, divine spellcasting powers are not granted by gods. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn to cast spells by channeling the supernatural forces of light and shadow that underscore the cosmos. In theory, such powers are attainable by anyone, but in practice only exceptionally gifted individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells. As such, divine spellcasting is viewed as a disciplined and sacred technique attainable only by those with sufficient will and devotion, and only after years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are not considered mageborn, or 'born with arcane magic' as wizards or sorcerers in this are.
- Violating one’s religious tenets will not cause a cleric, druid, or paladin to lose their powers. However, a personal crisis of faith brought on by some discordant change in behavior and morality could cause an individual to lose their divine spellcasting powers. More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin who commits some grave trespass risks retribution from other members of their religion.
- In the world of Drakkenheim, gods do not physically manifest in the world, intervene in mortal affairs, or speak directly with mortals. Myths and legends passed down from distant eons tell such tales, but these events have not happened in recorded history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets, oracles, and heroes laid the foundations for the world’s many religions.
- Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords, and outsiders exist and interact with mortals. Many extensively meddle in earthly matters, making pacts and offering dark counsel. Some even claim to be gods. When asked questions regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however, they speak in cryptic riddles.
