Valika religion: generally more on the fantastical end with some realistic elements that can be explored within it. Please ask me to elaborate on this.
Valika itself can be seen as a bit more of a region that has some apocalyptic fervor with it. Many people hold specific things as sacred when it suits them, being nature or combat or other details. A lot of them try to put different spins on what 'the end of the world' necessarily means for them, and how gods are now distant as I specify below:
> The original Gods who created the world Valika is in have died, their influence is still present on the world but a new Pantheon has taken over in their place. Filled with their former lieutenants or other powerful beings that have become the most powerful since "the Godfall." Prominent members of the new pantheon include certain angels that rose to power, demons, fey lords and ladies, and elemental spirits.
- The gods’ presence has waned. Divine power is rare in the world as a result. As a cleric or a paladin, you are a rarity, and your patron calls upon you to project their power into this world. Not very usual considering the world has entered into a Dark Age, the likes of which has never been experienced. Its people are starved for guidance and want to believe in a power greater than themselves. As a wielder of divine magic, you may use that hunger to bring hope and light to the world, or you could twist it to your advantage. Rarity is a form of power, after all.
- Arch Seraphs overlook the world with a righteous zeal, granting powers to a select few who fight in their crusades. Separated from their deities for so long, many of them have deviated from what they once represented, twisting their ideals into whatever suites their cause.
- Arch Daemons take delight in a world overrun by shadow and decay. Freed from the deities' power, they relish opportunities to feed their appetites. They take keen interests in mortal lives, often living among them, making deals and twisting fate to ensure threats to their existence are destroyed.
There's some clans that are really set in following their ways and there's some druidic worship in the region, which is generally in a more shamanistic or savage kind of way with how they do sacrifices to keep a world serpent type threat at bay.

Drakkenheim Religion: In the world of Drakkenheim, divine spellcasting powers are not granted by gods. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn to cast spells by channeling the supernatural forces of light and shadow that underscore the cosmos. In theory, such powers are attainable by anyone, but in practice only exceptionally gifted individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells. As such, divine spellcasting is viewed as a disciplined and sacred technique attainable only by those with sufficient will and devotion, and only after years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are not considered mageborn, or 'born with arcane magic' as wizards or sorcerers in this are.
- Violating one’s religious tenets will not cause a cleric, druid, or paladin to lose their powers. However, a personal crisis of faith brought on by some discordant change in behaviour and morality could cause an individual to lose their divine spellcasting powers. More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin who commits some grave trespass risks retribution from other members of their religion.
- In the world of Drakkenheim, gods do not physically manifest in the world, intervene in mortal affairs, or speak directly with mortals. Myths and legends passed down from distant eons tell such tales, but these events have not happened in recorded history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets, oracles, and heroes laid the foundations for the world’s many religions.
- Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords, and outsiders exist and interact with mortals. Many extensively meddle in earthly matters, making pacts and offering dark counsel. Some even claim to be gods. When asked questions regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however, they speak in cryptic riddles.
