# The Cosmos
Sages of the Amethyst Academy have put forth differing theories to explain the order of the cosmos throughout history. These included bizarre concepts such as the “great wheel”, the “world axis”, the “conjunction of the spheres”, “planetary orbits”, and “general relativity”. There is no consensus; every theorist is quick to point out the glaring flaws and logical inconsistencies in competing hypotheses. 
   Most mortal knowledge of the planes comes from contact with extraplanar creatures via summoning magic or divination spells such as contact other plane. Deliberate planar travel by mortals is the stuff of legends. The knowledge and material components for the plane shift spell are jealously guarded secrets. However, there are scant ley-lines and thin places where the unwary might slip between worlds. Described below are the most well-known.

# Mortal Worlds
The mortal world is a sphere of rock that orbits a fiery sun. Several moons and planets join this cosmic dance, all suspended in an endless astral void. Far away, the sparkling stars are other suns. Who can say what distant worlds lie among them?

# Otherworlds
These worlds are metaphysically close to the mortal world, such that some creatures can pass through the Ethereal Plane into the mortal world, and rarely vice-versa.
- **The Ethereal Plane**. A truly liminal space, this plane is the metaphysical border between the mortal world and the other planes. 
- **Dreamland**. This strange realm is the mortal unconscious made manifest. It is a world of thoughts, dreams, and nightmares, inhabited by impossible creatures. 
- **The Elemental Chaos**. A primordial place of raw energy and unbridled potential, the individual planes of air, earth, fire, and water are found within its churning storms and burning seas.

# Afterworlds
The afterworlds are places where mortal souls go when they die. There has been no recorded instance of a living mortal physically entering these planes and returning. However, the creatures who inhabit these worlds can be contacted or summoned using powerful spells.
- **The Shadowlands**. A dark reflection of the mortal world held in perpetual gloom. Most souls pass into the Shadowlands on their way to the afterworlds, but some wander here forever. Why certain souls remain in this place, and others pass on is the subject of many religious myths. The energies from this place may be invoked to create undead.
- **Eternity**. The sacred celestial afterworld. Little is known about this holy place, but many religions believe it is a paradise for righteous souls.
- **Hell**. Sages believe that mortal souls are transformed into demons or devils in this fiendish afterworld. These evil beings plot mayhem and conspiracy against mortals when they are not waging endless war amongst themselves. Few mortals understand the distinction between such fiendish creatures.
