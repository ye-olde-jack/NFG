# Prep
- # Step 1: Major Fronts
A front is basically a villain or some kind of major issue. major issues can be something like an arcane disaster or natural catastrophe.
	- Come up with 3 to 5 villains or major issues: Amiri, 
	- Figure out the goal of each villain or the driving force behind each issue.
	- For each front figure out 3 major milestones that they must reach in order to achieve their goals.
- # Step 2: Major NPCs
Major NPCs are those who will be driving the action of the stuff we're doing.
	- Flesh out the NPC leading each front: some of this is already done.
	- For each front, create and flesh out an NPC opposing them. for villains this could be a rival. for issues this could be someone trying to prevent or prepare for the issue.
	- For each NPC, determine whether or not there is a faction that exists for us and our characters to interact with.
- # Step 3: World Events
Keeping the rest of the world on Drakkenheim alive:
	- Determine some major events that would be significant or interesting to some of our characters going on in town overall.
	- Decide when and how our characters show up. decide what relevant events might've been going on during that time.
	- Determine if there's some kind of special occasion or holiday occurring or approaching. maybe people are getting ready for or cleaning up after a holiday?
- # Step 4: PCs current goals and plans
	- Where is your character currently?
	- What are they trying to get to or where are they trying to go?
	- What are they trying to accomplish?
	- Determine who, if anyone, is trying to stop them.
- # Step 5: NPCs current goals and plans
What have the major NPCs been up to?
	- Decide what plans they have been making.
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to further their goals.
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to thwart one of the major fronts.
- # Step 6: Major Scenes
Potential scenes that might come up during play
	- For each Front, develop a scene of them moving forward their plans in some way. don't include how PCs end up in the scene.
	- Consider a possible timeline for each scene relative to the ones other people do. these don't need to be set in stone.
	- Figure out what would happen if the PCs never entered this scene. for example, what happens if the front succeeds? would that bring about one of their major milestones?
	- Think of ways to include some of your PCs goals or motivations into the scene.
- # Step 7: Plan out Minor Scenes
Have a handful of filler events or encounters ready.
**- Do a little transitional scene add-on that foreshadows some of the gnolls.**
	- For each PC who's goal you weren't able to include in a major scene, develop a scene where they're able to further their goals.
	- Roll for random encounters and have 1-2 of them ready for each hour of play.
	- Prepare a very brief outline for transitional scenes, such as shopping or resting in town.
- # Step 8: Scene Backgrounds
Further develop each scene.
	- For each scene, find or create a suitable map for the surrounding location if needed, such as a dungeon or a town map.
	- Write a description or background for each scene.
	- Select possible battle-maps for encounters.
	- Choose music or ambience for each encounter and scene.
- # Step 9: Secrets and Clues
What can the PCs discover about the world and events?
	- For each scene, come up with a secret that could give away important information.
	- For each location, come up with a piece of history or information that could either help the PCs explore it, or lure them to it.
	- For each session, have at least 10 secrets or clues, but don't include where, when, or how those secrets or clues are discovered. Reveal them at moments that make sense in-game.
- # Step 10: Aftermath
What happens after the PCs have done their thing? What does everyone else do?
	- For the scenes that PCs didn't enter, assume that one of the fronts succeeds, one of them fails, and the rest never come to fruition.
	- If the PCs changed one of the locations in a major way, such as clearing out a stronghold or dungeon, consider who or what will be waiting to take advantage of the new status quo.
	- Consider possible ways to reveal this information to the PCs in the future.
