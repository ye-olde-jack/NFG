- # Step 1: Major Fronts
A front is basically a villain or some kind of major issue. major issues can be something like an arcane disaster or natural catastrophe.
1. Villain one: Spencer D. Kramer. Amethyst Academy/Pale Man's acolyte.
\- Goal of the villain is to keep an eye on those coming into town. Primary goal to learn more about Delerium and outdo party members in every conceivable way. Petty incarnate.
\- Step one, provide equipment to make sure a few bandits survive. Step two, collect and offer fencing for bandits as long as they provide information. Step three, hire new bandits if old ones are dead and if all are dead- uh oh.
2. Villain two: Amiri/Queen's Men.
\- Goal: Have Levi SlaughterDale return to the WaterDale Troupe.
\- Step one, remain ever present in Levi's life and live rent free in his thoughts. Step two, do great things to get his attention and show off. Step three, offer Levi the occasional job or sent the occasional goon to talk up the Troupe- especially talking up Amari.
3. Villain three: Flamekeeper Isaac/Falling Fire.
\- Goal: Make Thalia into weapon that defeats the Silver Order.
\- Step one, demonstrate Thalia as capable tool to Rupert and have Rupert ingratiated into local church scene. Step two, have someone Thalia cares about in Silver Order or in Falling Fire- either get hurt by Order or love Falling Fire, which the Silver Order will hate by proxy. Step three, provide continual guidance and indoctrinate Rupert as second mentor figure. This will get Isaac in better graces for Lucretia.
\- Have Thalia keep the dog. It's an important way for her to learn something.

# Step 2: Major NPCs
1. Flamekeeper Isaac - Falling Fire Lieutenant.
\- Opposing NPC: High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed. Belonging to the Silver Order.
2. Spencer D. Kramer - Pale Man.
\- Opposing NPC: Ansom and/or Petra Lang. Belonging to the Hooded Lanterns.
3. Amiri - Queen's Men.
\- Opposing NPC: River. Amethyst Academy. Give her a scar on her face.

# Step 3: World Events
**Bolded are kept from prior session.** Major events in:
\- **Elyria include a recent adjudication for the Lord Regent being elected anew, parade for Knights of the Silver Order having gone by and clean-up is beginning, and a recent discovery of multiple mageborn has lead to a successful validation for the Edicts of Lumen as the children get handed over to representatives of the Amethyst Academy. The children are all coming from a cult that got busted and murdered but that's way less public.**
\- **Caspia includes the sorcererous houses in a frenzy after some killings done by the notorious Spencer D. Kramer, specifically House Bajavi (Illusions and Necromancy), House Gauth (Evocation and Abjuration), and House Eyerul (Conjuration and Divination). A circus called the Happyhollow Circus recently had several members leaving to Drakkenheim after several missing animals lead to the disbanding of the circus.** Lastly, best weather of the year due to some magical intervention from a few of the different city-states Sorcerous houses collaborating.
2. Season is winter, day is 11/29, and year is 1914.
3. Holiday approaching is the Feast of the Faithful at the end of the month.
- # Step 4: PCs current goals and plans
	- Where is your character currently?
	- What are they trying to get to or where are they trying to go?
	- What are they trying to accomplish?
	- Determine who, if anyone, is trying to stop them.
PCs are currently on the route to Drakkenheim, guiding Erin Marlowe.
What they are trying to do:
\- Emile is trying to get more information about Spencer D. Kramer and help Dr. Mobius do right.
\- Levi is trying to get status in the Amethyst Academy. Will be told to pay tribute to the Queen via letter.
\- Dr. Mobius is trying to help Levi accomplish his goal and research the flesh from Rikard.
\- Thalia is serving Rupert and receiving guidance. Will also be attempting to keep new dog safe. Huskie dog.
\- Rupert is trying to suss out Amethyst Academy some, but also recently got told by Flamekeeper Isaac to reign in Ophelia Reed.
Who is trying to stop them:
\- Amiri is trying to stop Levi without compromising his position. Actually thinks it could be a unique thieving opportunity. Ensure that connections are well kept to the Queen of Thieves, of course.
\- River is trying to stop Rupert. River is also impeding the direct progress of Levi, due to the magic he wields and how it's demonstrated.
\- Spencer D. Kramer or Abominations trying to stop Emile from getting information about him. After the events at the road, any escaped people will provide Kramer with information that Emile was among the attackers, and scrying on Emile will begin.
\- Flamekeeper Hanna is worried somewhat about Thalia's first big trip away from the church and Emberwood. She'll want to make sure the dog has a good home, will Flamekeeper Isaac will say otherwise to.
\- The Knights of the Silver Order would want to keep an eye on Dr. Mobius.
- # Step 5: NPCs current goals and plans
What have the major NPCs been up to?
	- Decide what plans they have been making.
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to further their goals.
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to thwart one of the major fronts.
- New plan for Flamekeeper Isaac: get Thalia that dog and have attached to it.
- New plan for Kramer: Prepare for some scrying on Emile. Maybe do up a d20 roll for that if or when it happens.
- New plan for Amiri: Get Levi to pay tribute to him or to the Queen of Thieves. Since Levi's a solo agent, he's liable to do this unless he wants the extra attention.
1. Flamekeeper Isaac is newly considering how to have this dog stay with Thalia. He'll even have her make some calligraphy for a collar for the dog.  As for reworking his plans, the radio jamming from Ophelia Reed is a pain in the neck but he'll pay no mind to it for now. Flamekeeper Hanna might see it as more worrisome.
2. Spencer D. Kramer is mobilizing Abominations and looking for magic items. His bandits getting thwarted leaves him nonplussed, so he might try equipping Boog with a new toy to subvert whoever does best in the group.
3. Amiri is chillin after writing Levi that letter. He'll be planning his next big score, probably on one of the biplanes from the Hooded Lanterns or something similarly significant.
\- Kramer will talk with the Pale Man and see if there's a good, safe way to give some mutations to his creations thus far.
\- Amiri can have one of his lieutenants draw away a Hooded Lantern to the Black Ivory inn. Then, during a meeting with the player characters if there is one- he strikes with the Kurimo (BFF of Levi) to get the plane.
\- Flamekeeper Isaac goes to speak with and attempt to take a few of the Knights of the Silver Order back to the Church, as a gesture of good faith and to begin converting them.

\- Ophelia Reed can attempt to make an insight check on Flamekeeper Isaac, or do a divination spell about it if she's got one. On a success from her, low chance, she allows for some of the forces to go but among them is a striker that may attempt to do harm to Flamekeeper Isaac or accidentally Hanna. On a failure from Ophelia, she finds this act gracious and has a light presence of the Knights there.
\- River has no way of knowing about the biplane going missing. However, once she finds out she might dispatch some kind of summon or nasty elemental to harm those that took it. Amiri might use this as a way to defend what's been going on, as well as to show Levi the types of bedfellows he's trying to gain.
\- Hooded Lanterns increase patrols around Emberwood and keeping a more thorough watch, instead of doing things in the city.
- # Step 6: Major Scenes
Potential scenes that might come up during play
	- For each Front, develop a scene of them moving forward their plans in some way. don't include how PCs end up in the scene.
	- Consider a possible timeline for each scene relative to the ones other people do. these don't need to be set in stone.
	- Figure out what would happen if the PCs never entered this scene. for example, what happens if the front succeeds? would that bring about one of their major milestones?
	- Think of ways to include some of your PCs goals or motivations into the scene.
**Each front has scene of them moving forward plan in some way: **
- Include some rumors of an old friend of Dr. Mobius in town. This person has plans to go see the Pale Man but doesn't know about Mobius and would otherwise get caught if no intervention gets made. **If not entered, further rumor later on about this person going missing at a relevant adventuring site.**
- Spencer D. Kramer in the wake of releasing his two abominations has started to consider a trio of adventurers. These three people just spoke with him and are finishing that interaction. **If not entered, rumor gets relayed via a Hooded Lantern and adventuring party loses one of their members.**
- Flamekeeper Isaac reinforces that Rupert knows best, reminder.  Also, an NPC from either Rupert or Thalia's backstory has gone missing into the Black Ivory inn. Flamekeeper Isaac sent them that direction to garner some sympathy. **If no chance to report, Flamekeeper Isaac will instead put away the note in a 'what you don't see' moment and focus more on something else.**
- Write out the letter from Amiri to Levi, to be received via bandit. Momentary freak out when letter gets discovered from bandit, who has more gold in his pouch than initially expected too. Letter mentions to wait until Emberwood to open it. **If the letter gets ripped up or ignored, Cora from the nearby bar ends up bumping into Levi in the next day or so, flirts pretty strongly. Might address him as 'the anon' but promises not to tell anybody. Says she overheard him from somewhere.**
> Timeline upon arrival on the 30th: Amiri letter received day before, Isaac gets to do sharing of info during Feast of the Faithful, mention of rumors concide with the three adventurers getting to talk with Spencer D. Kramer.
- # Step 7: Plan out Minor Scenes
Have a handful of filler events or encounters ready.
	- For each PC who's goal you weren't able to include in a major scene, develop a scene where they're able to further their goals.
	- Roll for random encounters and have 1-2 of them ready for each hour of play.
	- Prepare a very brief outline for transitional scenes, such as shopping or resting in town.
## Never filled in Step 7 last time. Do better next time.
- # Step 8: Scene Backgrounds
Further develop each scene.
	- For each scene, find or create a suitable map for the surrounding location if needed, such as a dungeon or a town map.
	- Write a description or background for each scene.
	- Select possible battle-maps for encounters.
	- Choose music or ambience for each encounter and scene.
- Find or create a suitable map, done for Emberwood but maybe doodle it up too. **Also doodle up more on the battle map for the day.**
- Write a small description for the fighting area for the day. **Rewatch the Runesmith bandit video.**
- No Cleric beast music moments.
- # Step 9: Secrets and Clues
What can the PCs discover about the world and events?
	- For each scene, come up with a secret that could give away important information.
	- For each location, come up with a piece of history or information that could either help the PCs explore it, or lure them to it.
	- For each session, have at least 10 secrets or clues, but don't include where, when, or how those secrets or clues are discovered. Reveal them at moments that make sense in-game.
1. ~~Marlowe: Secret chest in the back of the car.~~
2. Ophelia: Reed was the one who was messing with the radio frequencies, due to her artificers setting up signal jammers in the midst of Camp Dawn.
3. ~~Ansom: Petra Lang was captured during a supply run from one part of the city to another. She's at the Rat's Nest tavern.
4. ~~River: has a secret project that she needs a large chunk of Delerium for and is willing to pay a fat sum of 1250 for it.
5. ~~Battlefield from last session: was a fight site for Xandor IV, not the most evil of the Sorcerer-Kings but a prominent one known for his ability to have the dead march for him.~~ **Only got mentioned briefly for #5**
6. ~~Older artificer: Scion guy has been asking some stuff about the inner city and plans to hire an adventuring party, some might say.
7. Chapel of Saint Ardenna: recent talks and rumors about someone from a different part of the Outer City that can apparently Purge Contamination. A miracle that many are doubting.
8. Destroying Delerium: is something that River is rumored to be proficient in doing or finding the steps to be able to do so.
9. ~~Hanging: occurred in the village not too long ago, maybe a week. Some young man mageborn who was a potential pilgrim of the Falling Fire tried to charm a member of the Silver Order, got executed and hung from the Gallows for violating an Edict of Lumen.
10. Graveyard has Elijah Hendrix: visiting his dead wife who isn't buried very far from where Rupert has his wife buried. Will offer to talk and tell Rupert some stuff about Hendrix farm.
## Strikethrough is PCs got that one.
- # Step 10: Aftermath
What happens after the PCs have done their thing? What does everyone else do?
	- For the scenes that PCs didn't enter, assume that one of the fronts succeeds, one of them fails, and the rest never come to fruition.
	- If the PCs changed one of the locations in a major way, such as clearing out a stronghold or dungeon, consider who or what will be waiting to take advantage of the new status quo.
	- Consider possible ways to reveal this information to the PCs in the future.
- Didn't enter list
	- Heard about Scion, but didn't immediately seek him out.
		- Consequence: Good is that they potentially have a trail to follow that will exist before the group gets to the Inner City. Bad is that the Abominations potentially get another member.
	- Didn't go and see the three people that Spencer D. Kramer was talking to.
		- Consequence: 
- Did enter list
	- Levi did read the letter that he got and plans to act on it.
		- Consequence: Good is boons from Queen's Men like potential mundane items, payment for jobs, and having a fence to work with for selling stolen goods like Kuromi, a Levi NPC. Neutral or bad is River potentially catching sight of this going down.
	- Flamekeeper Isaac did get to talk with Thalia in a 'Rupert knows best' moment.
		- Consequence:
