- James Ockman was the one who was responsible for the radio jamming. He's an example of other partnerships between the academy and the Silver Order.
- For the social event of the Feast of the Faithful, consider making a generic map for parts of -Emberwood and using pieces of printer paper to do smaller maps where players can enter and interact with people. Sounds like a really fun idea and a decent way of spending time in the build up of the session this week.
- Do the Tarchaeology one-shot for the group at level nine, but start foreshadowing that Baron Bodrum is in the game right about now. Have some of the Queen's Men or Silver Order talking about him, he's a Drakkenheim noble with ties to Elyria and the Hooded Lanterns for funding them.
