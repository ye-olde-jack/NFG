# Prep
- # Step 1: Major Fronts (Done)
A front is basically a villain or some kind of major issue. major issues can be something like an arcane disaster or natural catastrophe.
	- Come up with 3 to 5 villains or major issues: Amiri, Ophelia Reed, Flamekeeper Isaac, Spencer D. Kramer, River, and Captain Ansom.
	- For Amiri, Ophelia, Isaac, and Ansom: see session four notes.
		- Spencer D. Kramer **In Progress**
			- Have a manic and contaminated individual, mutated Marcus (once a paladin), from the Falling Fire spread some more rumors around Emberwood Village regarding how dangerous the city is, and how water from the river are making travelers sick. (Foreshadow flood travel sequence)
			- Fire off some spells to distract from the firework show. Especially good fireworks will distract from this but it will go down to a spellcasting check between Doctor Mobius and Kramer, who gets a +6 bonus.
			- Introduce a few seeds that will grow in the soil of Emberwood. (These will become Twig Blights in several sessions, or some other hostile plant)
		- River **In progress**
			- Have her showcase through a few banners that she offers a rate of 50% higher rewards in gold per the exchange of Delerium.
			- Mention potential for cooperation of Ironhelm Dwarves prospecting in the scar.
			- Denounce the Malfeasant mage within Reed Manor and make an announcement that gathering for a party of adventurers to solve the problem of his presence will be made public.
- # Step 2: Major NPCs (Done)
Major NPCs are those who will be driving the action of the stuff we're doing.
	- Flesh out the NPC leading each front: some of this is already done.
		- Current leads
			- River: Amethyst Academy
			- Flamekeeper Isaac: Falling Fire
			- Captain Ansom: Hooded Lanterns
			- Kuromi: Queen's Men
			- Ophelia Reed: Silver Order
	- For each front, create and flesh out an NPC opposing them. for villains this could be a rival. for issues this could be someone trying to prevent or prepare for the issue.
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Opposing Academy
		- River: Opposing Falling Fire, but not directly Isaac.
		- Spencer D. Kramer: Opposing Hooded Lanterns
		- Captain Ansom: Opposing Queen's Men
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Opposing Silver Order
	- For each NPC, determine whether or not there is a faction that exists for us and our characters to interact with.
		- **Completed**
- # Step 3: World Events (In Progress)
Keeping the rest of the world on Drakkenheim alive:
	- Determine some major events that would be significant or interesting to some of our characters going on in Drakkenheim overall.
		- **The Hooded Lantern group stationed as a supply gang has no clue what day it is and has been hosting bets between each other whether they would be making it back home in time for the Feast of the Faithful.**
		- **Rumors that a man with seven eyes tends to the sick in an old water treatment facility. Some say people have even come away from it without the touch of contamination.**
		- ~~**Lord Commander leaves Emberwood to regroup forces by Shepherd's Gate, apparently on watch for attacks from Gnolls to the Outer City.**~~
		- **Knight Captain apparently leading forces within Camp Dawn on strenuous training sequence, ensuring they are prepared for anything to come.**
			- Can be found out on DC 13-15 check of some kind: Was apparently requested to stay there by Ophelia Reed.
		- ~~**Lucretia Matthias apparently met with some representatives from Arcadia that have since split up after hearing a prophecy from her. Unknown what the prophecy is, but the previous three member Council of Arcadia has split to join the Silver Order, retire to the Shrine of the Morrigan, and travel to Queen's Park Garden.**~~
		- **The name of Eldrick Runeweaver once again thanked as personally present for the receiving of Mageborn from Elyria. A recent discovery of multiple mageborn has lead to a successful validation for the Edicts of Lumen as the children get handed over to representatives of the Amethyst Academy. The children are all coming from a cult that got busted and murdered but that's way less public.**
		- Elyria include a recent adjudication for the Lord Regent being elected anew, parade for Knights of the Silver Order having gone by and clean-up is beginning.
		- Caspia includes the sorcererous houses in a frenzy after some killings done by the notorious Spencer D. Kramer, specifically House Bajavi (Illusions and Necromancy), House Gauth (Evocation and Abjuration), and House Eyerul (Conjuration and Divination).
		- Trade relations with the nearing continent of Kislev are booming in this post-war era.
	- Determine what day, season, year, etc. it currently is.
		- Day is November 30th, 1914.
	- Determine if there's some kind of special occasion or holiday occurring or approaching. maybe people are getting ready for or cleaning up after a holiday?
		- People are getting ready to clean up after the Feast. Most are going to be shaken from some of the recent events, but not a lot of people are stressing over it and took time to clear away from being near the Chapel as a result.
- # Step 4: PCs current goals and plans (Done)
	- Where is your character currently?
		- Thalia is heading into Drakkenheim with the rest of the party, having just finished assisting in the eventful part of the Feast and being told to head into the City by Flamekeeper Isaac.

		- Dr. Mobius is attempting to get fireworks together for the Feast to do some decent celebrating and call an appealing look to be cast on the academy.
		- Levi secured the Rope Trick scroll with help from Dr. Mobius. He's bringing his bike, Jessica, into the city with him.
		- Emile is heading into the city after having calmed down multiple members of the Chapel post events during the Feast.
	- What are they trying to get to or where are they trying to go?
		- Thalia is trying to get to the Chapel and is there, mostly to be present for the feast. Hanna is going to suggest Thalia uphold her values as she sees fit to.

		- Dr. Mobius wants to get people to look favorably upon the academy. He also wants to get some Delerium and the crystal for River.
		- Levi is trying to help Emile rescue Petra Lang. Getting some money is also on his priority list.
		- Emile is trying to save Petra Lang and the rest of the supply line.
	- Determine who, if anyone, is trying to stop them.
		- Oops! All Ratlings.
- # Step 5: NPCs current goals and plans (Done)
What have the major NPCs been up to?
	- Decide what plans they have been making.
		- **Completed.**
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to further their goals.
		- **Completed.**
	- Figure out what each NPC could do to thwart one of the major fronts.
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Opposing Academy.
			- Advocate against the purchase and selling of Delerium.
		- River: Opposing Falling Fire.
			- Warn others against the Falling Fire and mention that Lucretia Matthias is a liar and that the Falling Fire has no clear unified beliefs among them, that the beliefs will differ among the lot of them.
		- Spencer D. Kramer: Opposing Hooded Lanterns
			- Recently provides Delerium to the Ratlings and is responsible for giving the Rat Prince a Delerium grill braces set.
		- Captain Ansom: Opposing Queen's Men
			- Host some presence around the Bark & Buzzard.
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Opposing Silver Order
			- Follow through with his existing agenda in the plans phase.
- # Step 6: Major Scenes (Done)
Potential scenes that might come up during play
	- For each Front, develop a scene of them moving forward their plans in some way. don't include how PCs end up in the scene.
		- River:
			- "Curt whispers and a few odd stares go in the direction of the tiefling woman bearing five academy rings on the hand she gestures behind her with, to a large construct standing at her side at attention bearing over the many feast goers and folk trying to enjoy their meals. "Delerium sale prices have risen fifty percent and will remain so until the dawn of the new year. Expect a notice for the cooperation with the Ironhelm dwarves within the Scar, as well as a separate notice for the retrieval and detainment of the malfeasant mage Oscar Yoren, open to any who would count themselves brave enough to travel through the Outer City towards Reed Manor. Flame... be with you, and have an amenable Feast."
				- PC Motivations:
					- Emile: 
					- Levi: Interest in Delerium.
					- Mobius: Interest in the Academy.
					- Rupert: Interest in Delerium.
					- Thalia: Mutual thing with Rupert, maybe. Especially with the chance to do away with the Ironhelm dwarves.
		- High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed:
			- PC Motivations: *Play an instrumental of Stand by Me:* "Denying the trouble and the times of the past year and years before it would be an ignorance unto the Lantern by which the way is lit, and it is my solemn duty to ensure that this light shines not only to recognize all of you here but to show what among you that you may have yet seen. Entrenched within this Chapel, this monument to Saint Ardenna, is the Candle... and I am sorry to say that it hath cast a shadow that our torch had yet found. For our wire-wrights within the bounds of Camp Dawn so kept away by the same who holds aloft that shadow casting Candle. Given the opportunity to come forward and clear the air, I have no doubt they would bring to light a fitting means to show focus in the flame and secret away the truth towards the *Shadow.* How much I can say without diverting thine eyes from the bounty our Heart brings you, I know not, though I have an ease in my heart and an assurance in my step that those who wish to take their ears and minds to align with truth- join me for a short time before I away to cultivate light to bring by this shaded community."
					- Emile:
					- Levi:
					- Mobius:
					- Rupert:
					- Thalia: **Barbarian**
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Even amidst these words it cannot be called untrue to say we are stewards of the Flame and, also, of Emberwood Village. Just t would be wrong to turn away from the tenet of the Candle as Saint Vitruvio embodies. Though our brothers and sisters of the Flame may put themselves to represent the Torch and the Lantern, each, we maintain a willingness to house both- is that not true, fellow Flamekeeper?
			- PC Motivations:
					- Emile:
					- Levi:
					- Mobius:
					- Rupert:
					- Thalia:
		- Spencer D. Kramer: A lot of the witchfires are burning along the multitudinous parts of the outer city. Monsters seem to be pulling closer to them,
			- PC Motivations:
					- Emile:
					- Levi:
					- Mobius:
					- Rupert:
					- Thalia:
	- Consider a possible timeline for each scene relative to the ones other people do. these don't need to be set in stone.
	- Figure out what would happen if the PCs never entered this scene. for example, what happens if the front succeeds? would that bring about one of their major milestones?
	- Think of ways to include some of your PCs goals or motivations into the scene.
- # Step 7: Plan out Minor Scenes (Done)
Have a handful of filler events or encounters ready.
	- For each PC who's goal you weren't able to include in a major scene, develop a scene where they're able to further their goals.
		- R
	- Roll for random encounters and have 1-2 of them ready for each hour of play.
	- Prepare a very brief outline for transitional scenes, such as shopping or resting in town.
- # Step 8: Scene Backgrounds (In Progress)
Further develop each scene.
	- For each scene, find or create a suitable map for the surrounding location if needed, such as a dungeon or a town map. **Needing color.**
	- Write a description or background for each scene.
		- Chapel of Saint Ardenna: 
			- **Exterior**: "Located at the heart of Emberwood Village is a small chapel of the Sacred Flame. The circular fieldstone building has a copper domed rooftop, thin windows set with stained glass depicting a few modest scenes of saints, and simple wooden double doors at the front. Outside is a small crematory garden and scattering plot for the ashes of the dead."
			- **Interior**: "Within the chapel is a well-used bronze brazier of the Sacred Flame, alight with golden fire that burns all night and day."
		- Caravan Court: "Surrounding the boarded-up water well in the village square. This colorful collection of caravans, wagons, canvas tents, and makeshift stalls is the hub of commerce for adventurers, scavengers, and prospectors looking to make their fortune in Drakkenheim. Dozens of canny merchants have set up shop here to cater to the needs of the factions and explorers."
			- **Marlowe's Mercantile Menagerie:** "Decently large but makeshift stall with a few wooden tables displaying jars of dried fruits, packages of cured meats, jugs of water, mead, and bags of assorted nuts. Adventurers often come here for provisions that won’t rot or spoil during their treks into the contaminated ruins"
			- **Aldor the Immense:** "A massive and heaving covered carriage is decorated with gold filigree and glimmering lanterns. Hitched beside it are two great steel-skinned oxen that exhale green fumes from their snouts. Three lanky attendants garbed in light armor and carrying crossbows patrol the grounds. Seated before the carriage on a buckling wooden chair is a massive human man who must be nearly seven feet tall and almost as wide awaiting his next customer."
		- Bark & Buzzard: 
			- **Exterior:** "Nestled amongst the residential cottages of Emberwood Village, this small one-level public house is a popular spot for locals and adventurers seeking a peaceful and laid back place to unwind. The sign hanging above the door depicts a cartoonish vulture feasting on the entrails of a bloodhound, both smiling pleasantly."
			- **Interior:** "The public house has a cozy and familial character: there’s no proper bar, nor any walls separating the kitchen from the dining room. Instead, a few benches are arranged beside the main cask, and about a dozen round tables surround an inviting hearth."
		- Red Lion Hotel: 
			- **Exterior**: "The three-story manor is made of red brick. Featuring lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green. The estate of Kosta Stavros includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room."
			- **Interior**: "A full service staff is catering to the patrons’ every need. Meals are being taken to a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlor furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the village or the surrounding countryside."
			- **Parlor**: "The parlor against the back wall is stocked with an array of strange bottles, keg faces, and other barware that makes sure the beer is around. Beer is safer and more abundant than water, after all."
	- Select possible battle-maps for encounters.
		- **Kinda did that.**
	- Choose music or ambience for each encounter and scene.
		- DO THIS!!!
- # Step 9: Secrets and Clues (In Progress)
What can the PCs discover about the world and events?
	- For each scene, come up with a secret that could give away important information.
	- For each location, come up with a piece of history or information that could either help the PCs explore it, or lure them to it.
	- For each session, have at least 10 secrets or clues, but don't include where, when, or how those secrets or clues are discovered. Reveal them at moments that make sense in-game.
		1. ~~Amiri's plane has some fuel with some Delerium in it.~~
		2. The green fires from Kramer are a variant of Witchfires which will be part of a a little fey spirit event within Drakkenheim where some spirits are let out into the world to do things and cause little mischiefs; A lot of the materials that he was gathering from Tobias were going to go into witchfire supplies.
		3. Kramer is the one throwing out fireballs and other spells along the outer city to scare people in Emberwood.
		4. ~~Amiri was the one who stole the plane, himself.~~
		5. Thieves' Cant can be something that either Emile or Rupert can learn about via a history check or something similar when looking at people. It's something to learn on a dice check, more likely for Emile.
		6. The Rat's Nest used to be a pretty spotty dive bar that people who now serve as Queen's Men frequented.
		7. The names of the Arcadian Council are Eoghan Ghostweaver, Cyrilia Verdenta, and Neldor Willoweep.
		8. Mageborn children from Elyria were actually rescued from some kind of cult.
		9. The presence of Kislevite people has been found traveling through Emberwood and moving in the direction of Buckledown Row.
		10. Saint Vitruvio was once a farmer before he became a Saint.
		11. ~~Lucretia Matthias was said to begin publishing the Testament of the Falling Fire before the fall of the meteor, but others say they've found publications dated after as the first.~~
- # Step 10: Aftermath (In Progress)
What happens after the PCs have done their thing? What does everyone else do?
	- For the scenes that PCs didn't enter, assume that one of the fronts succeeds, one of them fails, and the rest never come to fruition.
		- Captain Ansom: In Progress.
		- Amiri: Succeeded.
		- River: In Progress.
		- High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed: Failed.
		- Flamekeeper Isaac: Succeeded.
		- Spencer D. Kramer: In Progress.
	- If the PCs changed one of the locations in a major way, such as clearing out a stronghold or dungeon, consider who or what will be waiting to take advantage of the new status quo.
	- Consider possible ways to reveal this information to the PCs in the future.
