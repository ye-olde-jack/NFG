# Politics
#### Von Drakken family line
- Instead of being cartoonishly evil, the von Drakken line was hardly exceptional, and their dynasty came to an end when they were politically outmaneuvered by the von Kessels. This opens up a von Drakken heir as a much more doable storyline.

#### Elyria
- The last Elyrian King is going to step down, meaning you could play a PC who was the last king, and people like Lucretia Matthias may have more to say about the event.

# Wider World
#### General Lore
- Figures in myths and legends, like St. Vitruvio, are mostly invented post-hoc.
- Drama. It feels like in some places, the worldbuilding actually stamps out drama rather than facilitates it. For example, in the Eastern Vales and Liberio, the people are expressly said to be suspicious of monarchism. I submit it would be better if there is actually ambivalence towards it with a small but motivated faction striving to set someone as the ruler. The scramble for power is an interesting story, one that the PCs can thwart or even participate in. For a separate matter, why are there so few kingdoms? In many dramatic tales, a smaller state or body is key to tipping the balance of power. If it were up to me, there would be dozens of small kingdoms on the continent. They wouldn’t all need to be enumerated, but their existence would make for another wrinkle in the world order.

# Languages
#### Common (Westemäran) (Reikspiel)
While there are regional variations and accents, the Westemäran language is fairly common across the country. The Warhammer Fantasy term for their language is Reikspiel, which is roughly “realm-speak”, which just adds a naturalistic term for the language. Roughly 90-95% of your NPCs should speak this if they speak at all.

#### Classical
Classical is a direct analogue for Latin. It still sees use as a liturgical language, and we can imagine that many documents and inscriptions in holy places like the Chapel of St. Brenna, the Cathedral, and the Castle’s Chapel are written in Classical. It is an old and obtuse language, and isn’t ever used for interpersonal communication anymore.

#### Elyrian
Elyrian is descended from old Classical, and is then analogous to Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Italian. This is the first language of the Knights of the Silver Order, but their role in international crises means that all of them have training in Westemäran, though few have mastery.

#### Caspian
Similar to Elyrian, but its own unique language, a different lineage. If Elyrian is Spanish, Caspian is French.

#### Kislevite
In my construction of the world, goblinoids aren’t a menace that lurks all throughout the continent, but a rival nation with their own land, Kislev, analogous to medieval Slavic states. The presence of some goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears among the Queen’s Men means that Kislevite will appear at least occasionally.

#### Elven
The Elves rarely share their language anymore. Its use is found in a few scholarly books in old Academy recesses, but elves and half-elves rarely use it, even to communicate among themselves.

#### Celestial
The Celestial language is more like a sophisticated tolling of bells, strikes and notes rather than “words”. It can be read, but is nearly impossible to be spoken among mortals. It is a special language that can share general ideas with any listener, even if they don’t have any knowledge of the language.

#### Skyic (Dwarvish)
In my construction of the world, the dwarves wiped themselves off the face of the continent, but survived on the islands of Skye off its northwest coast. Skye is roughly analogous to Arthurian England and the British Islands, and the language is descended from Old Dwarvish.

# False Languages
#### Abyssal / Infernal
Just as demons and devils are conflated by the author, so too Abyssal and Infernal are conflated. Whatever horrid tones these evil beings use to twist meaning to each other, ear cannot perceive, nor can hand write. Some evil cults claim to write rune-signs of these evil languages, but any such meaning is imagined.

#### Primordial / Deep Speech / Sylvan / Undercommon
The presence of the Elemental Plane, the Far Realm, the Feywild, and the Underdark are completely alien concepts in the world of Drakkenheim, and if the inhabitants of such planes have any such thing as “spoken language”, mortals wouldn’t understand it.

#### Orc / Halfling / Gnomish
We can assume these races and others might have their own language, but they are so integrated with the nations of the continent that their language fails to have use. Even Elven and Skyic/Dwarven start to fall under this umbrella. We can assume that other exotic races might similarly have their own exotic language, one that doesn’t have any pragmatic use.

#### Druidic / Thieves’ Cant
These languages are codes, hand gestures, signs of respect, simple signals and etchings. We can treat them as class features rather than a dedicated language.

#### Draconic
As per my write-up on my vision for dragons in a low-fantasy setting, it doesn’t involve language.

#### Giant / Gnoll
Let some monsters of the city have their own language, unknowable to the PCs. Special individuals might have some grasp of Westemaran, like the trolls that demand the troll toll. But for many cases, these monsters can be simple and misanthropic, with no room for negotiation or communication.

# Creatures
#### Dragons
- Unintelligent beings that are not classified into specific types, can breathe any element or be of any size.

#### Goblinoids
- Kislev: A nation of goblinoids that is currently in the process of emerging from a society of warriors into its own civilization.

#### Giants
- Giants as a recent race, created by the Amethyst Academy in the last 300 years, still finding their place in the world. Only 10’-14’ tall instead of the traditional 30’ behemoths.
