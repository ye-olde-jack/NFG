# Design Reminders + Edits
**Add in a little item that's dirty and offers some cooperation between Levi and the Doctor! Something that a Ratling is fighting with!**
- Little bit of (1d4+2) acid damage in exchange for a poisoned condition to stick on later turns.
- Cost 75 GP to make.
- Con save, low. DC 11.
- Happens once per turn and ends at end of next turn or maybe if they use their bonus action on it? Probably just at end of turn.
Have Ansom reach out via radio to the party to say the following.
- “Amongst the Hooded Lanterns, our survival doctrine says we don’t risk lives on ‘futile’ rescue attempts. We all knew the dangers when we signed up, but she’s my sister.”
**The right eye of the idol in area 6 cannot be removed with mage hand. Behind the eye is a poison trap.** 
- Any creature within 10 feet of the statue when the eye is removed must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage. A creature who fails by 5 or more suffers a level of contamination.
**Petra has a +3 proficiency bonus and knows Enhance Ability instead of Spike Growth.** 

Time of Entry: 2:35 PM

# Developments:
- Yielding the delirium chunk to River rewards 1500 gold and the Aqua Delirium, while also adding renown to the Amethyst Academy. Yielding the delirium chunk to any other faction or keeping it for themselves reduces renown from the Amethyst Academy.
	- Reducing renown means less likely jobs. More careful consideration for jobs if at all.
	- River becomes more reticent to hand out scrolls if asked or prompted.
	- Keeps a stricter eye on Dr. Mobius and requests regular reports.
	- Next work comes in 2d6 days instead of 1d6.
- Rescuing Petra rewards a potion of necrotic resistance and some knowledge on recent updates for stuff going on in the Outer City of Drakkenheim, specifically stuff about Backbreaker's Lair and also about the Bullywug's Pad. While not increasing the renown of the party within the Hooded Lanterns, returning Petra makes Ansom a more reliable ally.

# Dungeon General Info:
These details are common to most areas within the ratling burrows: 
- **Passages**. The tunnels are dug out from packed earth, clay, loose dirt, and bits of stone. The cramped passages are five to ten feet wide, and rarely more than six feet high. Medium-sized creatures must stoop throughout. The tunnels weave and bend left and right, but also up and down.
- **Chambers**. The larger rooms are eight to ten feet in height. They are mostly dry past the entrance, but unrecognizable filth, bone fragments, scraps of fur and cloth, and bits of leaves and grasses lay underfoot.
- **Light**. The ratlings rely on their Darkvision for sight, so there are no light sources within.
 ![[Pasted image 20250103012325.png]]
- **Sounds and Smells**. The air underground is humid and warmer than it is above ground. It reeks of rat urine and feces. The sounds of squeaking and chattering ratlings as they scrape and scurry about can be heard down the tunnels.

## Scrag Lane (Surrounding the Tavern)
> The Rat’s Nest Tavern lies on the mud-slick and rubble-strewn Scrag Lane south of Shepherd’s Way, nestled between ramshackle tenements and crumbling flats. The original tavern has been almost entirely obliterated, and the neighboring buildings are heavily damaged. What remains are stone foundations piled with debris. The first-floor walls stand about chest high, a few supporting timbers splayed outward like a burst ribcage. The rooftop and upper levels have entirely collapsed into a mist-covered crater filled with rubble. The original tavern sign juts out obliquely from a building on the opposite side of the street. It is engraved with a smiling, obese rat laying on a plate of food.
> - **DC 17-20 Perception Success:** Characters who search the streets for nearby sewer entrances may discover the hidden entrance to the ratling burrow through the sewers.

## Taproom Ruins
> Inside what remains of the tavern walls, the wooden floorboards of the ground level have almost entirely collapsed into a large gaping hole. Tumbled brick piles, ashen cinders, burned shingles, splintered wooden planks, support beams, fractured furniture, cracked mugs, broken glass, random bits of bone and cutlery are scattered everywhere.
> - The hole opens to the basement ten feet below. Sheer drop.
> - Investigation or Survival (DC 10). Animal-like scratchings, gnaw marks, patches of coarse fur, muddy tracks, and rat droppings may be found by examining the area.

## 1 Cratered Basement
> The stone walls of the basement are scorched and blackened. Rubble and debris surround a muddy crater fifteen feet wide and five feet deep. A faint glimmer of octarine light twinkles within. 
- Examining the crater for the source of the glow turns up 6 delerium slivers (worth 10 gold each). 
 
 >There’s a distinct rocky divot about a foot wide just off the center of the crater, as if a large hunk of rock was dug out and excavated. If there was a meteorite here, it’s gone now.

 **Background Detail**: The ratlings removed a chunk of rock fused with a delerium crystal from the crater and dragged it into the Seer’s Den (Area 8).
 - - A Survival (DC 10) check reveals drag marks, muddy tracks, and clawed footprints of several beastly creatures indicating something heavy was removed from the crater recently. DC 15 or higher means this happens within weeks.
 - Investigation (DC 10), or proficiency with mason’s tools/ stone working. The breached wall was not caused by the meteor impact. The passage was dug relatively recently. DC 15 or higher means this happens within weeks.

## 2 Trapped **Entrance** Passage - Entrance
> This muddy passage is roughly eight feet wide. It tunnels steeply down ten feet before veering sharply left.
- **Perception (DC 10)**. The wet mud is slippery, and could lead to a nasty fall. 
- **Mudslide Trap**. Characters without a climbing speed travelling down the entrance passage must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or slip on the muddy slide. **Characters using a rope gain advantage on the saving throw**. Characters who fail this save fall prone and immediately slide down the passage, where they are deposited onto the **pit trap** in the **Lookout’s Burrow (Area 3)**.
	- Pit trap is a ten foot drop and deals 1d6 from falling, also knocking the creature Prone.

## 3 Lookout’s Burrow 
>The sound of soft rustling and chittering rats fills this muddy earthen den. 

**Encounter type:** Targeted Strike. It's very likely that the players see the ratlings before they see the players.
- 2 ratling guttersnipes and 6 ratlings are on watch. 
	- Each carries a crossbow (small rifle) and a few prepared flasks of alchemist’s fire. 
		- One of these guttersnipes has the acid poison recipe.
			- Bonus action to apply.
			- DC 11 Con save, taking 1d4 acid damage per turn and suffering poisoned condition.
	- Pit Trap. A spiked pit trap ten feet deep is dug in the ground at the base of the Trapped Entrance Passage (Area 2). The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with mud and debris. Perception (DC 10) spots the pit. 
		- Anyone who moves onto the cloth falls into the pit onto the sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom, and takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage from the spikes, and 5 (1d10) damage from the fall. The edges of the pit are slippery, making escape difficult. Climbing out requires a DC 10 Athletics check. A creature who fails by 5 or more falls back onto the spikes.
		- A **swarm of rats** lives at the bottom of the pit, and begins devouring anyone who falls within. The swarm attacks any creature in the pit as food.

**Killed all except one who they got information from and then let go. Told to come back seven days later.**

## 4 - Ratling Nests
> This tiny dugout cavity contains a cup-shaped nest made from long grasses, hay, mud, twigs, and leaves, and is lined with shredded bits of discarded cloth, fur scraps, bits of leather, paper, and small glimmering trinkets. 

**Encounter Types:**
1. One will be a skirmish for the players unless they see it in advance.
2. The other one will be an ambush based on the other fighting sounds. For the ambusher rat, give him a bonus action Quarry mechanic like Levi has!

**Replace one of the Guttersnipes with a Glutton in the stats doc when feels appropriate.**

8 ratlings and 1 ratling guttersnipe are present in each nest cluster, scattered across the individual nest cavities. 
- Ratlings hoard small trinkets as personal treasure, plus a delerium chip (10 GP value) or a pouch of 10 (3d6) gold.
	- Chip in the north.
	- Gold in the south in the form of some Elyrian war medals.
- One nest contains a potion of healing, probably the south one.

## 5 - Food Caches 
> Haphazardly splayed about this rancid-smelling den are all manner of recently-scavenged dead animals, body parts, and other unsavory stores.

- Living meat stays well-preserved, so occasionally prisoners are tied up here for a fresh meal later. **This is a Loss Scenario for the party.**
- Treasure.
	- The north cache contains thieves’ tools, a poisoner’s kit, an herbalism kit, alchemist’s supplies.
	- MAYBE contains one to two potions of healing.
- The south cache holds a still-living captive prisoner - Petra Lang of the Hooded Lanterns (an urban ranger). 
	- She is unarmed, wounded (with 20 hp remaining), and has expended all her spell slots but one at second level. However, she’s willing to help fight her way out if provided a weapon. Characters can recognize her as a Hooded Lantern lieutenant by her cloak and garb. If she survives, she asks the characters to help her get back to Shepherd’s Gate. She can make the trip on her own, but wants the characters to meet her comrades.

## 6 - Idol of the Rat God
> This chamber contains a bloated effigy of a horrifically obese demonic rat made from rubble, mud, and rat feces, set with two pieces of delerium for eyes. Offerings are scattered about the statue’s feet — skulls, bone, daggers, bits of rotting meat, and smaller delerium fragments. Before it lies a blood-soaked altar made from a simple stone slab.

**Encounter Type:**
1. Stomp. They either flee or die in one to two hits.

6 weakling ratlings attend the shrine. They flee for help if intruders arrive here.
- Treasure. The eyes of the idol are delerium fragments (worth 100 gold each). 5 delerium chips are scattered about the altar. Several scrolls are placed at the altar here — bane, faerie fire, and inflict wounds.
	- All at DC 13, +5 to hit modifier.

## 7 - Gathering Den
> Bales of hay and animal skins surround a glowing bonfire in this large fetid chamber. 

**Encounter type: Boss Fight**. Play the Cleric Beast theme.

The Rat Prince is often found here carousing with six other ratling warriors.
- The ratlings meet here to discuss their nefarious and ill-conceived plans. There are several sets of tools in this room — including tinker’s tools and alchemist’s tools, which the ratlings use to create makeshift weapons and improvised explosives. 
- This burrow tunnel opens into the sewers which from some of the underground subway can be seen. The ratlings flee here and scatter if they are wounded or cannot defend their lair.

**Lair Effects:**
- d4 roll.
	- 1. Ratling uses up an offering from the Gathering den for a spell scroll.
	- 2. 1d4 extra ratlings pile in.
	- 3. Petra supplies some covering fire to the party, using a reaction can impose disadvantage on an attack for a player.
	- 4. A spell scroll gets used by Petra, either Healing Word or player can get 1d4 to attack or damage for their turn.

## 8 - Seer’s Den 
> In this spacious chamber is a large and sumptuous basket nest. Woven over the nest is a canvas made from stitched together scraps of fine cloth, twigs, and choice leaves. Before the nest is a rough stone plinth upon which is placed a hunk of silvery rock about a foot wide. A protruding delerium crystal is embedded in its surface.

**Encounter type:** Complication. Squeaks will have her imp familiar Porsche sound an alarm after a few of the party members and try attracting attention to them. Either in betrayal to the Rat Prince or as payback for him turning.
	Gives Disadvantage on Random encounter rolls.

- Squeaks the Seer keeps her nest here. She has an imp familiar who remains in rat form. In its true form, it resembles a disgusting winged and hairless rat. 
- The delerium crystal is here. It’s still stuck in a rocky chunk: a combination of stone from the tavern basement, melted earth, and meteoric rock. The Ratlings dislodged it and brought it here because they couldn’t break the crystal from the rock themselves. It's a dangerous process that will take an hour at least The chunk of rock weighs about eighty pounds.
